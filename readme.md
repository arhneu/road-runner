ROAD RUNNER by Philip Oliver
for the Dragon 32, January 1984

--------------------------------

This is the original code for
ROAD RUNNER, the first published
game by the famous "Oliver Twins".

It was first published as a type-in
submission to "Computer & Video Games"
in January 1984.

It is presented here in its original
form although syntax errors visible
in the original printing have been
corrected.

The .bas file included is a plain-text
ASCII BASIC file that can be edited
or loaded directly into most Dragon 32
emulators (tested on Xroar)
and then loaded like a cassette
using the CLOAD command.
